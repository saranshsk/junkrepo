Installing Spark on the hadoop cluster

Master Server Setup:
We will configure our cluster to host the Spark Master Server in our NameNode & Slaves in our DataNodes. Lets ssh login to our 
NameNode & start with the Spark installation. Select the Hadoop Version Compatible Spark Stable Release from the below link
http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html

sudo mount -t vboxsf softwares /softwares
Enter the password for sudo user.

wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.0.0/spark-2.0.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
tar -xzvf spark-2.0.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
sudo mv spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7/ /usr/local/spark
sudo chmod -R 775 /usr/local/spark/
sudo chown -R hadoop /usr/local/spark/
sudo chgrp -R hadoop /usr/local/spark/

Set the Spark environment variables in .bashrc file. Append below lines to the file and source the environment file.
vi ~/.bashrc
export SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/spark
export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin

Save the above file and run below command to refresh the variables
source ~/.bashrc

Next we need to configure Spark environment script in order to set the Java Home & Hadoop Configuration Directory. Copy the template file and then open spark-env.sh file and append the lines to the file.
cd $SPARK_HOME/conf
cp spark-env.sh.template spark-env.sh

Make changes to the above spark environment file:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop
export SPARK_WORKER_CORES=6

Next we have to list down DataNodes which will act as the Slave server. Open the slaves file & add the datanode hostnames. In our case we have two data nodes.
vi slaves
datanode1
datanode2


Slave Server Setup

Now we have to configure our DataNodes to act as Slave Servers. In our case we have two DataNodes. We will secure copy the spark directory with the binaries and configuration files from the NameNode to the DataNodes.
cd /usr/local 
scp -r spark datanode1:/usr/local
scp -r spark datanode2:/usr/local

Next we need to update the Environment configuration of Spark in all the DataNodes. Append the below two lines in the .bashrc files in both the DataNodes.
vi ~/.bashrc
export SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/spark
export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
source ~/.bashrc

Repeat the above step for all the other DataNodes. Well we are done with the installation & configuration. So it's time to start the SPARK services.
. $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-all.sh

Let us validate the services running in NameNode as well as in the DataNodes.
On the namenode:
jps - Master
On the datanode:
jps - Worker


On the gatewaynode/edgenode:
For the namenode run the following command:
sudo scp -r spark hadoop@edgenode:/home/hadoop
On the gatewaynode run the below commands:
sudo mv spark/ /usr/local/spark
sudo chmod -R 775 /usr/local/spark/
sudo chown -R hadoop /usr/local/spark/


Browse the Spark Master UI for details about the cluster resources (like CPU, memory), worker nodes, running application, segments, etc. at http://10.0.0.1:8080/
In our case we have setup the NameNode as Spark Master Node. Also the Spark Application UI is available at http://10.0.0.1:4040. 

So we have finally installed SPARK in distributed Hadoop Yarn.
