First we will ssh login to our EdgeNode. Before installing PIG, we already have a release of Hadoop installed and configured. We will install PIG in the same base directory path where we already have our Hadoop binaries & configuration files and all other client tools in /usr/local.

Next, we will download a recent stable release of PIG from the below Apache site:
http://www-us.apache.org/dist/pig/pig-0.16.0/
Next follow the Installation steps as below:

wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/pig/pig-0.16.0/pig-0.16.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf pig-0.16.0.tar.gz >> /dev/null
sudo mv pig-0.16.0 /usr/local/pig
sudo chmod -R 775 /usr/local/pig
sudo chown -R hadoop /usr/local/pig

Next we will set the PIG Environment variables in the .bashrc file. Append the below lines, save and quit.
vi ~/.bashrc
export PIG_HOME=/usr/local/pig
export PATH=$PATH:$PIG_HOME/bin
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/local/pig/lib/*:.
export PIG_CLASSPATH=/usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop

Source the environment file.
source ~/.bashrc

Now let us validate pig is installed properly:
pig -version

Finally we have installed and configured PIG. Now let us write some simple pig latin scripts and validate the execution.
